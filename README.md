### Quick presentation:
This project is a small demo of Gale-Shapley Algorithm. Gale-Shapley algorithm is a classic matching algorithm used in mathematics, economics, and computer science fields.
### Situtation: 
- We have two groups of individuals with the same number of members.
- Each member of a group ranks the members of the other group based on some criteria.
- The goal of the algorithm is to find a set of pairs such that there is no single individual and no unstable pair.
- A pair (x,y) is said to be unstable if there is another pair (z,w) such that x prefers w to y and w prefers x to z, in that case it x and w will tend to be together.
